1. Naming conventions for all filenames, paths and folders
    - The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase with no spaces, however dashes are accepted. Path naming conventions should have the folders, assests and files inside the root folder for simple linking inside any .html files. Folder naming conventions should be similar to filenames.
2. Best practices for commit messages
    - Commit messages should have a minimum of 3 words and 10 characters, with proper spelling and grammar throughout. Commits should be written starting with a capital letter, an imperative verb, and no periods at the end.
3. What is HTML?
    - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is the standard language used in the creation of web pages. Markup symbols and code inserted into a .html file are intended to be displayed on the internet, which tells web browsers how to display various words and images.
4. Proper syntax for HTML tags
    - The tags used to define the purpose of text on a web page are composed from special characters: <, > and /. The proper tag syntax starts with a specific word or letter surrounded by angle brackets, then in between is its content, and ends with a forward slash and the same word or letter surrounded by angle brackets.
    - Ex: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
5. Explain or demonstrate commonly used html tags/elements:
   headings: <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>
    - HTML heading tags are defined from h1-h6 and are used to display headings based on importance on the web page, h1 being the most importance and largest heading, and h6 being the least important and smallest heading.
   p: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    - Paragraph tags are used to define a paragraph of text. It is a block-level element, meaning it always starts on a new line of text. There is spacing before and after each paragraph since all browsers add margins by default.
   lists: <ul> <ol> <dl>
    - In the HTML language, lists are used to display data in a structured format, and there are 3 types of lists in total: unordered lists (ul), ordered lists (ol), and definition lists (dl).
    - Unordered lists, or <ul>, is a list of items where the order of the items does not matter, and are typically displayed using bullet points.
    - Ex: <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
          </ul>
    - Ordered lists, or <ol>, is a list of items where the order of the items does matter, and are typically displayed with numbers.
     - Ex: <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
          </ol>
    - Definition lists, or <dl>, is a list of items that consists of a term and its definition.
    - Ex: <dl>
           <dt>Term 1</dt>
           <dd>Definition 1</dd>
           <dt>Term 2</dt>
           <dd>Definition 2</dd>
           <dt>Term 3</dt>
           <dd>Definition 3</dd>
          </dl>
   a: <a href="URL">Link Text</a>
