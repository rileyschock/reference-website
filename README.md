1. Naming conventions for all filenames, paths and folders
    - The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase with no spaces, however dashes are accepted. Path naming conventions should have the folders, assests and files inside the root folder for simple linking inside any .html files. Folder naming conventions should be similar to filenames.
2. Best practices for commit messages
    - Commit messages should have a minimum of 3 words and 10 characters, with proper spelling and grammar throughout. Commits should be written starting with a capital letter, an imperative verb, and no periods at the end.
