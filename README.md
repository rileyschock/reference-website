1. Naming conventions for all filenames, paths and folders
    - The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase with no spaces, however dashes are accepted. Path naming conventions should have the folders, assests and files inside the root folder for simple linking inside any .html files. Folder naming conventions should be similar to filenames.
